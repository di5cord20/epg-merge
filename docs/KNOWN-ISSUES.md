# Known Issues & Solutions

## None Currently
- All systems functioning
- 64 tests passing
- Docker containers healthy

## Resolved
- ✅ package-lock.json sync (fixed in Phase 2)
- ✅ Docker build permission issues (fixed in Phase 4)
- ✅ Health check timeouts (increased start_period)

## Lessons Learned
1. Always regenerate package-lock.json after test dependency updates
2. Dockerfile needs proper user permissions for /config directory
3. Health check start_period should be 15s+ for Python app startup
