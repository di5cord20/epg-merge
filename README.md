# EPG Merge Application - Project Context

## Purpose
A production-grade TV feed merger application that combines multiple XMLTV EPG (Electronic Program Guide) files from share.jesmann.com, filters them by selected channels, and produces a merged XML file.

**Tech Stack:**
- Backend: FastAPI (Python) + SQLite
- Frontend: React 18 + CSS
- Deployment: Systemd service on Debian/Ubuntu
- API: RESTful endpoints + optional WebSocket

---

## Core Features (Completed ✅)

### 1. **Sources Tab**
- Fetches available `.xml.gz` files from share.jesmann.com
- Radio buttons for timeframe (3/7/14 days) and feed type (IPTV/Gracenote)
- Dual-list interface: available sources (left) ↔ selected sources (right)
- Search filtering on both sides
- "Select All (FullGuide)" shortcut
- Saves selections to localStorage (persistent across sessions)

### 2. **Channels Tab**
- "Load from Sources" fetches channel IDs from `*_channel_list.txt` files
- Dual-list interface: available channels ↔ selected channels
- Search filtering
- Move all/clear all buttons (⇒⇒ / ⇐⇐)
- **New:** Download/Upload backup buttons
  - Export selected channels as JSON file
  - Import previously backed-up channels from JSON
- Saves selections to SQLite + localStorage

### 3. **Merge Tab**
- Displays detailed merge log with color-coded output (success/error/warning)
- Real-time progress bar (0-100%)
- Session-persistent download button (survives tab navigation)
- **New:** "Save as Current" button
  - Archives previous `merged.xml.gz` with timestamp
  - Sets new merge as the live `merged.xml.gz`
- Clear Log button (clears session state)

### 4. **Archives Tab**
- Lists current `merged.xml.gz` (marked ✅ Current)
- Lists all archived versions with timestamps (marked 📦 Archive)
- Shows: filename, creation date, file size
- Download button for each archive
- Current file marked as ∞ (never expires)

### 5. **Settings Tab**
- Output filename (default: `merged.xml.gz`)
- Merge schedule (daily/weekly)
- Merge time picker (UTC)
- Live cron expression display
- Download/merge timeout settings (ms with conversion to seconds)
- Channel drop threshold (%)
- Archive retention (days)
- Discord webhook URL (optional)
- All settings persist to localStorage + SQLite

### 6. **Backend API Endpoints**

## Key Technical Details

### File Structure
```
/opt/epg-merge-app/
├── backend/
│   ├── main.py (FastAPI app - complete)
│   ├── venv/ (Python virtual environment)
│   └── static/ (React build output)
├── frontend/
│   ├── src/
│   │   ├── App.js (main React component - complete)
│   │   ├── App.css (all styling)
│   │   └── index.js
│   └── package.json
└── setup-frontend.sh (build script)

/config/
├── app.db (SQLite database)
├── archives/ (merged.xml.gz + versioned backups)
├── epg_cache/ (cached XML files, 24-hour expiry)
└── helptext.json
```

### Database Schema
```sql
CREATE TABLE channels_selected (channel_name TEXT PRIMARY KEY)
CREATE TABLE settings (key TEXT PRIMARY KEY, value TEXT)
CREATE TABLE archives (filename TEXT, created_at TEXT, channels INT, programs INT, days_included INT)
```

### Storage Strategy
- **localStorage:** Sources, channels, settings, merge session state (client-side, persistent)
- **sessionStorage:** Merge log, progress, filename (survives tab navigation, cleared on browser close)
- **SQLite:** Channels, settings (server-side persistent database)
- **Filesystem:** EPG cache (24-hour TTL), archives with timestamps

### Merge Process
1. Download/cache XML files from share.jesmann.com
2. Use iterparse for memory-efficient streaming (not loading entire XML into memory)
3. Filter channels by ID match
4. Extract matching programmes
5. Write gzipped output to `/config/archives/`
6. Store metadata in SQLite
7. Return to frontend with file details

### Caching & Optimization
- XML files cached for 24 hours before re-downloading
- Channel lists fetched from `.txt` files (lightweight, not full XML)
- Iterparse used for XML processing (memory efficient for large files)
- 24-hour cache age check before download

### UI Features
- Dark mode toggle (🌙/☀️) persisted to localStorage
- Responsive design (works on desktop, tablet, mobile)
- Real-time progress tracking
- Color-coded terminal-style log output
- Persistent session state for merge completion

## Installation
```bash
sudo bash /path/to/install.sh
```

## Common Commands
```bash
systemctl status epg-merge              # Check service status
systemctl restart epg-merge             # Restart service
journalctl -u epg-merge -f              # View live logs
bash /opt/epg-merge-app/setup-frontend.sh  # Rebuild frontend
```
